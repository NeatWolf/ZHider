# ZHider
ZHider is a tiny and easy-to-use utility that can instantly hide windows (programs) with a quick keystroke. Windows are hidden completely from view and from the task bar without a trace. Hidden windows can easily be brought back into view with another quick keystroke that toggles their visibilty from hidden to visible. Handy for a wide range of practical uses including removing annoying, clutter windows (too many instant messages?), holding secret messages for yourself that you don't want to save or close, protecting privacy if someone wanders by, and yes -- even hiding windows from employers.
